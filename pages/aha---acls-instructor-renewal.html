An American Heart Association (AHA) Instructor has to renew their certification every two years.  When an AHA instructor needs to recertify, they do not have to go back through an instructor course. They do, however, have other processes to complete to maintain their certification.
AHA INSTRUCTOR RENEWAL REQUIREMENTS:

Teach a minimum of 4 classes in 2 years

These classes can be a mix of Instructor Led or Heartcode courses




Pass both the Provider and Instructor exams for each discipline taught


Complete Skills Verification for each discipline taught


Keep current with all updates from the AHA


Be monitored by Training Center Coordinator or an AHA Faculty instructor designated by the TCC


The monitoring instructor will fill out the appropriate paperwork to process


The instructor is also responsible for maintaining AHA standards as outlined in the ECC Leadership Code of Conduct and the Program Administration Manual (PAM).


Failure to meet these requirements will result in the need to take the Instructor Course from the beginning, unalignment from the Training Center, or possible termination of certification.   We, of course, want to help you avoid these frustrations.  See below.">
