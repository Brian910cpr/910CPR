    <meta name="description" content="Enroll in ARC -  PALS Blended Learning at 910CPR. Select a date/time for your skills testing.  We will provide a link to the online course upon payment.
 

PALS classes are easy to integrate into your life with our innovative Blended Learning program. By combining online coursework with an in-person skills session, they allow you to learn at your own pace – and in the place, and on the device, you like best. Throughout the course, our interactive scenarios will help you understand the often-nuanced facets of pediatric care and will help improve your clinical decision-making skills. After completing the online portion of course, and passing the final written exam, you'll attend an in-person skills session where you'll demonstrate your PALS skills to a certified Red Cross instructor. Once you've passed both sections of the course, you'll receive a two-year Pediatric Advanced Life Support certification.">
