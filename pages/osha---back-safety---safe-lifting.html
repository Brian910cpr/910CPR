Back injuries are a prevalent occupational hazard, causing significant human suffering, loss of productivity, and economic burden. Our course is designed to address OSHA's expectations outlined in the OSHA Technical Manual (OTM) Section VII: Chapter 1. Whether it's a result of repetitive activities over time or a single traumatic event, back injuries can be debilitating. Acute injuries often stem from improper lifting techniques, but the real cause may be years of weakening due to repetitive micro-trauma.
